General roadmap
===============

* Basic documentation
* Examples
* Unit tests
* "Job" tests

1.0
===

* IO channels management:
  * Multiple input/output possible for each transformation, with default channels (DONE)
  * "Converging stars" (V model), "diverging stars" (reverse V) and diamond should be possible.
  * See how we deal with cycles, I guess a "health check" pass is necessary to ensure that all paths have an end.
* Error handling
  * exceptions are sent to stdout, destroying statuses
  * there should be recoverable and fatal errors
  * stderr should be a special output stream that handle exceptions, and all stdouts should be plugged into some
    handler.
  * errors should appear in status
* React to Control-C (KeyboardInterrupt)

1.1
===

* IO services management:
    * database/webservices/mails/files/etc ...
    * stats (r/w)
* Better Log() (nice tables wanted)
* Catchall for unplugged IO channels ? For example, all messages going to unplugged STDERR channels could be sent to a
  given transform, so we can act (email ...)

1.2
===

* Whatever will prove usefull until then.
