Contributing
============

`The code is available on github <http://github.com/rdconseil/etl/>`_.

Fork the code and make pull requests. It's probably a good idea to discuss ideas before implementing them.

You're very welcome to improve the documentation, or the unit tests.

A roadmap file is available at the project root, so you can read our general path.

This package is used on live systems, and no backward incompatible feature will be implemented in 1.x after 1.0.0 has
been released (at least, we'll try). See `Semantic Versionning <http://semver.org/>`_.
